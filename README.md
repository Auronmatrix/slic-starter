SLIC Starter is a complete starter project for production-grade serverless applications on AWS. SLIC Starter uses an opinionated, pragmatic appraoch to structuring, developing and deploying a modern, serverless application with one simple, overarching goal:

> _Get your serverless application into production fast - first time and every time_

_How does SLIC starter help you to move so fast?_

1. Serverless development involves a lot of decisions around which approach to take for a multitude of issues. It aims to remove 80% of this decision making and let you focus on building valuable features.
1. It is deployable _out of the box_. Without making any code changes, you have a cloud-hosted production-grade app as a starting point for your product.
1. It comes with solutions for the common hard-to-solve problems such as project structuring, deployment, local environments, testing, monitoring and more. Read on to find out more!
1. It delivers a fully automated CI/CD build and deployment process that gives reassurances around the state and quality of each environment.
1. SLIC Starter fulfils all of the [SLIC Principles](https://slicsoftware.com), a set of best practices for _Serverless_, _Lean_, _Intelligent_, _Continuous_ development.

This project is free to use by enterprise, startups, students, educators, enthusiasts and skeptics alike. We actively encourage contributions, suggestions and questions from _anyone_.
